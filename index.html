                <h2>What is the AI</h2>
                <p>
                My main goal in this article is to bring you up to date about the 
                AI specific about its usage in medicine. But what is this acronym? 
                AI (artificial intelligence) is a discipline in computer science. You probably see and use it every day
                without even knowing it. Voice assistant, Smart Home and navigation all these things are using the AI.
                It deals with the automation of intelligent behavior and machine learning. How does that  improve our lives you might ask yourself? 
                So AI is very useful in many different ways. It has better decision making, improves business processes and increases both accuracy as well as speed. So with AI you will find
                the best and easiest solution to any problem you have.
                In this blog, we are going to take a look at the knowledge and usage of 
                AI in chemotherapy as well as the AI as a useful method to supervise patients.
                I want to give you an overview of the use of AI in oncology, and another point is going to be supervising patients with the AI.
                So we are taking a closer look at how this works and talking about its future.
                After that, we will talk about the positive and negative points and discussing it.

                <h2>Medicine and oncology and why is the AI included</h2>
                <p>
                    Oncology, also called Carcinology, is a faculty in medicine. Mainly the goal is to research, investigate
                    and treat  cancer. They try to understand the mechanism of formation of the tumors, carcinomas, 
                    sarcomas etc. and seek the best means to fight it. Mostly it is done in the following four methods: chemotherapy,
                    hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and specific cancer therapy. The most common, that we are going to take a look at afterwards,
                    is chemotherapy. Why does the AI get included in oncology, and medicine in general?
                    The AI has a bright future in the medical field. It has the capability to fundamentally transform medicine.
                    The AI can provide great support, especially in the oncology. AI have a quick understanding how cancer cells become resistant
                    to their drug, which can help improve the development and adjust the usage of the drug. So in this blog we are taking a look at 
                    the AI in chemotherapy and the AI in supervising patients.

                <h2>AI in the usage of chemotherapy</h2>
                <P>
                Chemotherapy is the most known and most used cancer treatment. They include the usage of cytotoxic drugs. These drugs involve cell division that leads to the death of 
                the cancer cells. As good as this sounds it has also a negative effect. They also attack the healthy body cells leading to side effects. The AI gets
                included in the chemotherapy because it adapts the treatment to the individual patient better. Each individual patient has his or her own treatment plan produced by the AI. What is the
                use of such an individual plan and why should it be used? So this can not only reduce the side effect but it also
                can increase the effectiveness of the treatment because each patient has its perfectly planned treatment and the patients can get well without
                the unnecessary consumption of medicine. Using AI in this manner can lead to a drastic decrease of the related waste of medicine.

                <h2>AI supervising patients</h2>
                <p>
                Another benefit attributed is that the AI can supervise the patients in the clinic. They also can follow on all the ingestions of drugs. They have
                an Video-based AI algorithm to scan the patient's face to make sure, that the drug is ingested. That procedure happens in 8 nanoseconds. This treatment
                improves the intake of the patient which leads The doctors can then use this information to treat the patient. This 
                could help solve the shortage of medical equipment. The same technology is usable for drugs which are not taken orally,
                but there isn't an algorithm yet. What is a algorithm and how does it function? An algorithm is a unique instruction for a given problem. An algorithm is a finite number
                of well-defined individual steps. So we use these algorithms to supervise patients whether you have cancer or need to take  drugs for another reason.

            <section id="5">
                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                The AI is in the usage of many different clinics all over the world. But is it as good as everyone says or does it also have negative aspects? I personally think the AI is superior to the
                human intelligence. It has a much more developed knowledge and it can be used in almost every field. Another big advantage is that the AI takes zero risks. With many proven points it is shown, that the
                AI proves both accuracy as well as great responsibility. In my opinion supervising patients like this, including the Video-based AI algorithm
                is one of the smartest things to apply. It solves so many problems like drug waste, giving the wrong dosis as well as many other reasons. Like mentioned above the procedure is really
                fast and is beneficial to the patient. It really can save a patients lives if the drug isn't ingested right. But on the other hand this is an really expensive advantage. The AI in the healthcare
                industry can vary up to a million dollars. The AI also support laziness and increases the unemployed proportion. Another critic things is the chance that an AI gets hacked.  Because like all software
                the AI us A disadvantage of the AI as well as an advantage for us human is,
                that the AI can't think outside the box. That means that the AI has no creativity. In my opinion that makes up the increase of unemployed people. There are hundreds of jobs where creativity is the key.
                As an example, Make-up artists and Interior designer can't be replaced by AI at the current state. But should the AI increasingly take over the medical part?

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                So my conclusion is, yes, the advantage of the AI should be used. The AI has made  incredible progress in the development and treatment of cancer drugs. We humans are limited to our own knowledge, that makes it difficult to chose
                the most appropriate treatment. It is often the case, that the wrong option is chosen by the doctor the patient misses out on the best possible way to get healthy and their condition actually decreases. AI on the other hand
                can make those difficult choices and have that missing knowledge and can personalize treatment for every different patient. In the future, AI is going to be used much more in medicine.
                They could speed up the process of new materials which then leads to an better development of cancer drugs. It is also expected to be an leader of human cancer research and treatment in the 
                future. The AI could not only speed up every process in medicine, but familirities like Elon Musk also think that: "Robots will be able to do everything better than us."
