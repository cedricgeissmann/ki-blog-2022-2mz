                <h2>What is the AI</h2>
                <p>
                My main goal in this article is to bring you up to date about the 
                AI specific about the usage in medicine. But what even is this acronym? 
                AI basically means artificial intelligence. What does that do you might ask yourself. So the AI is very useful in many ...
                In this article we are going to take a look about the knowledge and usage of the
                AI in the chemotherapy as well as the AI as an useful method to supervise patients.
                I wanted to give you an overview at the use of AI in the oncology but my main point is going to be the program to supervise patients.
                So we are taking a closer look at how this works and talking about its future.
                After that we will talk about the positive and negative points and discussing about it.

                <h2>Medicine and oncology and why is the AI included</h2>
                <p>
                Oncology, also called Carcinology, is a faculty in medicine. Mainly the goal is to research, investigatie
                and treat the cancer disease. They try to understand the mechanism of formation of the tumors, carzinomas, 
                sarcomas etc. and seek the best means to fight it. Mostly it is done in the following four methods: chemotherapy,
                hormonetherapy, immunotherapy and specific cancer therapy. The most common, that we are going to take a look at afterwards
                is chemotherapy. Why does the AI get included in oncology, and medicine in general?
                The AI has a bright future in the medical field. It has the capability to fundamentally transform medicine.
                These AI's can provide great support, especially in the oncology. AI have a quick understanding how cancer cells become resisstant
                to their drug, which can help improve the development and adjust the usage of the drug. So in this blog we are taking a look at 
                the AI in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and the AI in supervising patients.

                <h2>AI in the usage of chemotherapy</h2>
                <P>
                chemotherapy is the most known and most used cancer treatment. They include the usage of cytotoxic drugs. These drugs involve cell division that leads to the death of 
                the cancer cells. As good as this sounds it has also a negative effect. They also attack the healthy body cells leading to side effects. The AI gets
                included in the chemotherapy because it adapts the treatment to the individual patient better. So this can not only reduce the side effect but it also
                can increase the effectiveness of the treatment. With that usage of AI the waste of medicine will drasticly decrease.

                <h2>AI supervising patients</h2>
                <p>
                Another benefit that the AI has is, that it can supervise the patients in the clinic. They can follow on all the ingestions of drugs. They have
                an Video-based AI algorithm to scan the patients face to make sure, that the drug is ingested. That procedere happens in 8 nanoseconds. This treatment
                improves the intake of the patient which leads The doctors can then use this information to treat the patient. This 
                could help solve the shortage of medical equipment. The same technology is usable for drugs which are not taken orally,
                but there isn't an algorithm yet. What is a algorithm and how does it function? An algorithm is a unique instruction for a given problem. An algorithm is a finite number
                of well-defined individual steps. So we use these algorithms to supervise patients whether you have cancer or need to take  drugs for another reason.

                    <h2>Discussion</h2>
                The AI is in usage of many diffrent clinics all over the world. But is it as good as everyone says or does it also have negative aspects. I personally think the AI is superior to the
                human. It has a much more developed knowledge and it can be useful in paticularly everything. Another big advantage is, that the AI takes zero risks, with many proven points it is shown, that the
                AI proves accuracy as well as great responsability. In my opinion supervising patients like this, including the Video-based AI algorithm
                is one of the smartest things to apply. It solves so many problems like drug waste, giving the wrong dosis as well as many other reasons. Like mentioned above the procedere is really
                fast and is beneficial to the patient. It really can save a patients life if the drug isn't ingested right. But on the other hand this is an really expencive advantage. The AI in the healthcare
                industry can vary up to a million dollars. The AI also support laziness and increases the unemployed proportion. A disadvantage as well as an advantage for us human is,
                that the AI can't think outside the box. That means that the AI has no creativity. In my opinion that makes up the increase of unemployed people. There are hundreds of jobs where creativity is the key.
                As an example Make-up artists and Interior designer can't be replaced by AI at the current state. But should the AI increasingly take over the medical part?

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                So my conclusion is yes, the advantage of the AI should be used. The AI has made an incredible progress to the development and to the treatment of cancer drugs. We human are limited to our own knowledge that makes it difficult to chose
                the most appropriate treatment. It is often the case, that the wrong option is chosen by the doctor the patient misses out on the best possible way to get healthy and their condition actually decreases. AI on the other hand
                can make those difficult choises and have that missing knowledge and can personalise treatment for every diffrent patient. In the future AI is going to be used much more in medicine.
                They could speed up the process of new materials which then leads to an better development of cancer drugs. It is also expected to be an leader of human cancer research and treatment in the 
                future. The AI could not only speed every process up in medicine, many people like Elon Musk think that: "Robots will be able to do everything better than us."
