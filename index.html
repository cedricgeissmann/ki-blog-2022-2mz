                <h2>What is  Conversational Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                <section>
                <p>
                    Conversational AI, short CAI consists of two principle components: <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Machine Learning (ML)</b> is a type of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, <br>
                    in order to make decisions or predictions. <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <b>Natural language processing (NLP)</b> is a branch of AI that gives computers the ability <br>
                    to fully understand spoken words or text like a human would. With a combination of<br>
                    Computer Science and Linguistics, NLP makes it possible to analyse data in an efficient, unbiased way.

                <h2> Traditional Chatbots vs. Conversational AI </h2>

                <section>
                <p>
                    Thanks to these two components, the computer is able to not only give simple and often<br>
                    annoying responses that are seen in chatbots on online shopping websites such as <br>
                    <i>“Could you rephrase your question, I’m not sure I understand what you mean”</i> or <br>
                    <i>“I’m going to need more information on your problem”</i> even if you’ve already sent a long <br>
                    paragraph about your issue 2 minutes ago. With Conversational AI, you get personalised <br>
                    texts from a program that remembers information that you already gave.  
                </p>

                
                <p> 
                    A traditional chatbot needs a pre-written script, is told what to say in response to <br>
                    keywords and needs to be trained for every scenario, whereas a Conversational AI chatbot <br>
                    doesn’t need a script, but teaches itself through Machine Learning. It’s able to formulate <br>
                    follow-up questions and handle human variants.
                </p>

                        <li><b>Data Input:</b> A user provides input</li>
                        <li><b>Data Analysis:</b> NLP corrects any mistakes and breaks down text to make it easier <br>
                            to understand</li>
                        <li><b>Response Generation:</b> The virtual user formulates an appropriate response that <br>
                            is similar to a human interaction</li>
                        <li><b>Machine learning:</b> Inputs are analyzed over time and the AI learns to improve its <br>
                            responses and gets smarter</li>

                <h2>Conversational AI in Mental Health Care</h2>

                <section>

                <p>
                    There are different ways to use conversational AI, one is “therapy” Chatbots, which will <br>
                    be discussed in this article. 
                    With the current mental health crisis, a lot of people are in need of psychological care. <br>
                    Unfortunately, many people aren’t getting the help that they need. This is due to several problems in our society:
                    <br>
                    <ul>

                    <li><b>Stigmatisation of Mental Illness</b></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Expensive Health Insurance</b></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Missing Education</b></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Long waiting lists</b></li>
                    </ul>
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    In trying to overcome the mental health crisis, getting more accessible therapy and mental health <br>
                    education is crucial. This is why in todays digitalized life, chatbots that talk with the users about <br>
                    their well-being have been created. 
                    <br>
                    They can include psychotherapeutic techniques like CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) created by <br>
                    psychotherapists, offering therapeutic intervention without a therapist. The chatbots can ask about <br>
                    the users day, current struggles they are dealing with, techniques to calm the patient down or emotional <br>
                    regulation. Because of the incorporation of CBT, negative thinking patterns can be recognized and <br>
                    challenged. Targets for the application are people that are unable to access therapy as well as people <br>
                    that are receiving psychological care and need a little bit more support in their daily life.

                <h2>An example: Woebot</h2>
                <section>
                    <p><img src="woebot.png" alt="Woebot" style="float:right;width:100px;height:100px;"> </p>
                <p> 
                    Woebot is a free application that can be downloaded on iOS and Android devices. Essentially, it’s a <br>

                    Conversational AI that is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) <br>
                    and Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT). It sends a daily check-in notification in which the user is encouraged <br>
                    to talk about how they’re feeling, work on problems or play a word game that teaches CBT skills. There is <br>
                    also the possibility of keeping a mood tracker and gratitude journal or visiting short courses such as “Changing <br>
                    how you speak to yourself” or “Communicating your needs”. <br>

                    The research behind Woebot is done by the clinical psychologist that created the app, Alison Darcy.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <section>
                <p>
                    Now that we’ve established the basics about Conversational AI’s in Mental Health Care, let’s talk about <br>
                    the Pros and Cons. As already mentioned, Chatbots can provide accessible assistance that is free of charge, <br>
                    without depending on licensed psychotherapists that need years of training. Because there is still a lot of <br>
                    Sigma in the conversation about Mental Health, individuals may feel less afraid of receiving care when starting  <br>
                    out with a virtual assistant before seeking out professional treatment. CAI’s, when used daily, can also be <br>
                    part of a holistic care plan including traditional psychotherapy, as they offer support anywhere, no matter time <br>
                    or day. When conversational AI's detect certain keywords that tell them that the user may be in a crisis, they <br>
                    can give phone numbers to local intervention hotlines. In a study that investigated the efficacy of a conversational <br>
                    AI <a href=https://woebothealth.com>(Woebot)</a>, participants significantly reduced symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder, <br>
                    after 2 weeks of using the on CBT based app.     
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Obviously, there are going to be limitations to digital mental heath assistants.  It is clear that <br>
                    conversational AI chatbots are in no way a replacement for therapy, but simply a  tool for managing the <br>
                    users mental health when not having access to therapy. A chatbot cannot offer a sense of empathy for the user, <br>
                    nor can it diagnose mental illnesses and treat them. It could be harmful for people to think that only using <br>
                    a Conversational AI application when dealing with complex mental illnesses is sufficient, when in reality, they <br>
                    need to work with professionals. 
                </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <section>
                <p>In my opinion, Conversational AI’s are a good short-term way to get trough the current mental health crisis and <br>
                    therapy placement shortage, but I hope that they won’t be everlasting. Instead of programming applications that <br>
                    allow users to talk to an AI, which is a completely different experience than talking to a therapist and honestly <br>
                    just feels a bit weird, we should get to the root of the problem and not only treat its symptoms. We shouldn’t <br>
                    have to talk to a virtual agent without empathy or ability to form a human connection, in fact, we shouldn’t be <br>
                    living in such a messed up society that makes 13% percent of the population suffer from a mental illness. <br>
                    Nevertheless, I’m glad if even one person can better their mental health through one such application right now.</p>
