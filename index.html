                <h2>What is the AI</h2>
                <p>
                My main goal in this article is to bring you up to date about the 
                AI specific about the usage in medicine. But what even is this acronym? 
                AI basically means artificial intelligence. To give you the best understanding about AI's we are 
                going to use an example. In this article we are going to take a look about the knowledge and usage of the
                AI in the medicine, especially in the oncology.
                Also we are going to examine the program that is used in the oncology.
                Next thing is going to be discussing all the positive and negative points and what
                the AI's involve and what the possible future could look like.

                <h2>Oncology in general and why is the AI included</h2>
                <p>
                Oncology, also called Carcinology, is a faculty in medicine. Mainly the goal is to research, investigatie
                and treat the cancer disease. They try to understand the mechanism of formation of the tumors, carzinomas, 
                sarcomas etc. and seek the best means to fight it. Mostly it is done in the following four methods: chemotherapy,
                hormonetherapy, immunotherapy and specific cancer therapy. Why does the AI get included in oncology, and medicine in general?
                The AI has a bright future in the medical field. It has the capability to fundamentally transform medicine.
                These AI's can provide great support, especially in the oncology. AI have a quick understanding how cancer cells become resisstant
                to their drug, which can help improve the development and adjust the usage of the drug. So in this blog we are taking a look at the 
                technology of the AI in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. 
                about later.

                <h2>AI in the usage of chemotherapy</h2>
                <P>
                In the compartement chemotherapy, AI focuses more on the interaction of drugs and patient. The most important programs are the management
                of chemotherapy drug use, prediction of chemotherapy drug tolerance and the optimization of chemotherapy program. AI can not only make the optimisation
                process of the chemotherapy fast but it is also done in perfection. With a program done by researchers they could determinate the optimal dose of Zen-3694
