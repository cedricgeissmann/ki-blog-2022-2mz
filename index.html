            <h1>Conversational AI in Psychology</h1>
    
            <section>
                <h2>What is  Conversational Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>
                    Conversational AI, short CAI consists of two principle components: <br>

                    Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that enables systems to learn from experience, <br>
                    in order to make decisions or predictions. <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                     Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that gives computers the ability <br>
                     to fully understand spoken words or text like a human would. With a combination of<br>
                    Computer Science and Linguistics, NLP makes it possible to analyse data in an efficient, unbiased way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to these two components, the computer is able to not only give simple and often<br>
                    annoying responses that are seen in chatbots on online shopping websites such as <br>
                    “Could you rephrase your question, I’m not sure I understand what you mean” or <br>
                    “I’m going to need more information on your problem” even if you’ve already sent a long <br>
                    paragraph about your issue 2 minutes ago. With Conversational AI, you get personalised <br>
                    texts from a program that remembers information that you already gave.  
                </p>

                <h3> Traditional CHAtbots vs. Conversational AI </h3>
                <p> 
                    A traditional chatbot needs a pre-written script, is told what to say in response to <br>
                    keywords and needs to be trained for every scenario, whereas a Conversational AI chatbot <br>
                    doesn’t need a script, but teaches itself through Machine Learning.

                    <li>
                        <ul>Data Input: A user provides input</ul>
                        <ul>Data Analysis: NLP corrects any mistakes and breaks down text to make it easier <br>
                            to understand</ul>
                        <ul>Response Generation: The virtual user formulates an appropriate response that <br>
                            is similar to a human interaction</ul>
                        <ul>Machine learning: Inputs are analyzed over time and the AI learns to improve its <br>
                            responses and gets smarter</ul>
                    </li>
